Each folder contains it own readMe file specifying how to build the project. It is worth noting that this project was done in Linux and has not being tested in windows, feel free to make changes as you see fit. 
Some part of this project is still under development, specially, the peer to peer connection which requires a signalling server be implemented. 


## Future work 
Future work will go into using implementing the multithreaded application for a real robotic platform. Using the web visualitzation software in the javascript-C -version and the peer to peer data sending method, the final robotic application should included a broadcastting thread that allows the robot data be visualized on the web.

## Important
The deployment architecture library is still under development by the robotic research group in Ku Lueven. A complete open-source version of this software with documentation and explanation will be published in the nbear future.
